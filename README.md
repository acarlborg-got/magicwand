# MagicWand

This repository contains the VBA source code for the **MagicWand** Word add-in.
The macros were exported from the template and organised into text files for easier editing.

- `modules/` – standard code modules
- `forms/` – user form code
- `versions/` – unpacked template files for each release

Import any `.txt` file back into the Word template via the VBA editor if needed.

Development versions are stored in `versions/dev/` while stable releases live in `versions/stable/`.
